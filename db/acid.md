# ACID Properties

A transaction is a single logical unit of work which accesses and possibly modifies the contents of a database. Transactions access data using read and write operations.

In order to maintain consistency in a database, before and after the transaction, certain properties are followed. These are called ACID properties.

 - **Atomicity**: By this, we mean that either the entire transaction takes place at once or doesnâ€™t happen at all. If a transaction aborts, changes made to database are not visible. If a transaction commits, changes made are visible.
 - **Consistency**: This means that integrity constraints must be maintained so that the database is consistent before and after the transaction. It refers to the correctness of a database. 
 - **Isolation**: This property ensures that multiple transactions can occur concurrently without leading to the inconsistency of database state. Transactions occur independently without interference. Changes occurring in a particular transaction will not be visible to any other transaction until that particular change in that transaction is written to memory or has been committed. This property ensures that the execution of transactions concurrently will result in a state that is equivalent to a state achieved these were executed serially in some order.
 - **Durability**: This property ensures that once the transaction has completed execution, the updates and modifications to the database are stored in and written to disk and they persist even if a system failure occurs. These updates now become permanent and are stored in non-volatile memory. The effects of the transaction, thus, are never lost.

The **ACID** properties, in totality, provide a mechanism to ensure correctness and consistency of a database in a way such that each transaction is a group of operations that acts a single unit, produces consistent results, acts in isolation from other operations and updates that it makes are durably stored.
